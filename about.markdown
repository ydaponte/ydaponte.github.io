Hello! My name is Yennifer Santos and I'm a Software Engineer working for Microsoft.

We are living in a Data culture driven era and Data has never been more important to industries, businesses and people.

We all know how data is at the core of intelligent systems and smart decisions and we also know that data is being generated everywhere, growing at each second.

Since very early I've been passionated about data and technology around it and I'm always impressed on how this field has evolved and empowered people to do things that were not possible at all just some years back.

I'm creating this blog to share my perspective and experiences, so others can benefit from it.

Thanks for reading!
